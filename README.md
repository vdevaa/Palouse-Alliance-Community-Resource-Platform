# Palouse Alliance Community Resource Platform

## Project Summary

### One-sentence description
A community-focused React web application that organizes Palouse area events, organizations, and volunteer opportunities into a searchable, accessible hub for local health, wellness, and community resources.

### Additional information about the project
The Palouse Alliance Community Resource Platform is a React + Vite web application built to make local health, wellness, and community event resources easier to find and use across the Palouse region.

The app emphasizes accessibility, responsive layout, and a clean search-driven experience so people can quickly find relevant events and organizations.

**Key Features:**
- Public events calendar with category filtering and event search
- Organization directory with search and contact summaries
- Login/logout flow using Supabase authentication
- Protected dashboard area for authenticated users
- Multi-step event posting experience
- Mobile-friendly navigation and responsive layout
- Real-time data synced with Supabase backend

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `code/` directory
   - Add the following required variables:
     ```
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

### Building for Production

From the `code/` directory:
```bash
npm run build      # Build production assets
npm run preview    # Preview the production build locally
```

### Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite development server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Build production assets to `dist/` folder |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |

### Supabase Configuration

The project uses Supabase for authentication, data storage, and file management. Configuration is handled in `code/src/lib/supabase.js`:

- The client reads configuration from environment variables:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous public key

To connect to your own Supabase instance, update these variables in your `.env` file.

### Vercel Deployment

1. Import the repository into Vercel
2. Set the project root to `code/`
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
4. Add all environment variables in Vercel Project Settings:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Optional: `VITE_API_BASE`
5. The included `code/vercel.json` routes `/api/*` to serverless functions and all other routes to the SPA entrypoint
