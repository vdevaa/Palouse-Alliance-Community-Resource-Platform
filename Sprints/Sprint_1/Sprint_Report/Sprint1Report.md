## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
* [Design Schema and ER Model for Database](https://github.com/vdevaa/Palouse-Alliance-Community-Resource-Platform/issues/18): This feature was delayed to Sprint 2 becuase we are awaiting final confirmation from our clients, which will be discussed during our next meeting. This is okay to be pushed to a later sprint since not all tables were needed for this first sprint.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* We got a comphrehensive idea for the requirements of our project, that was our goal this sprint.
* In addition to the above, we were ahead on schedule and were able to start working on features like the website header and footer. Our target was requirement gathering and seting up our tech stack, both of which we completed.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* We all go our tasks done (with extra), there isn't anything we can do to improve becuase we got more than expected done and worked well together.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* We plan to setup the database to support the tables and RLS we need for our chosen sprint 2 tasks.
* We plan to continue working on the frontend to better match the mockups we created and got approved by the clients.
